# Computer Graphics assignments (a.y. 2022/2023)
Weekly assignemnts from the Computer Graphics course at Politecnico Di Milano a.y. 2022/2023.

## Compilation and execution

Requirements:

- Version of g++ that supports at least C++17
- shaderc
- GLFW3
- Vulkan development headers
- Vulkan validation layers

To compile all assignments run `make` at the project root. To clean the tree run `make clean` at the project root. 

To run an assignment first move into the assignement directory and then execute the compiled executable. If the executable
is not executed from the directory in which his models/textures/shaders, it could result in broken behaviour.
